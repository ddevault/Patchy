## Why should I use it?

Patchy is free and open source. Most Windows clients these days have become adware with premium versions
and other similar saddening things. Patchy will never be like this - no ads, no extra software in the
installer, and it comes with all the features, completely free.

## Download

These links will become active once the final release goes live.
